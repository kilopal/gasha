# 🛡️ Gasha Vision

**Gasha** (ጋሻ) means *shield* in Amharic.  
It’s a **defense-first package manager** built for a **zero-trust** world.

> Every package verified. Every signature checked. No blind installs.

Gasha protects developers from supply chain attacks by combining:
- Cryptographic signing (Ed25519)
- Transparent logs
- Hash verification
- Sandboxed installs
- AI-powered audits (coming soon)

**Mission:** Restore trust in open-source dependencies.
